# Renewable Energy Project

## Project Goal
- This goal of this project is to predict renewable energy output by analyzing the relationship between weather and past energy generation.

## Dataset Description
- This renewable power generation and weather conditions dataset is from kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pythonafroz/renewable-power-generation-and-weather-conditions?resource=download>. This datasets contains 196776 rows x 17 columns of data.
- Here are some explanation to specific columns in the dataset
- energy delta - The difference in energy consumption in Watt-hours (Wh) from the previous timestamp to the current timestamp.
- GHI - Global Horizontal Irradiance in Watts per square meter (W/mÂ²) measured by a pyranometer
- rain_1h - The amount of precipitation in millimeters (mm) measured over the past hour.
- snow_1h - The amount of snowfall in millimeters
