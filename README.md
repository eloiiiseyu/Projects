# Renewable Energy Project (WIP)
Eloise Yu started this project on May 12, 2024.

## Project Goal
- This goal of this project is to predict renewable energy output by analyzing the relationship between weather and past energy generation.
- Possible methods: ARIMA time series analysis model, machine learning models (linear regression, random forest), deep learning model (neural network model)

## Dataset Description
- This renewable power generation and weather conditions dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pythonafroz/renewable-power-generation-and-weather-conditions?resource=download) and it ontains 196,776 rows x 17 columns of data (over 3.3 millions of data points).
- Here are some explanation to specific columns in the dataset
  - energy delta - The difference in energy consumption in Watt-hours (Wh) from the previous timestamp to the current timestamp.
  - GHI - Global Horizontal Irradiance in Watts per square meter (W/mÂ²) measured by a pyranometer
  - rain_1h - The amount of precipitation in millimeters (mm) measured over the past hour.
  - snow_1h - The amount of snowfall in millimeters
